# Tokenomics

## Modeling
- `Tokenomics` Macroeconomic design of a token (inflation, utility, etc.).
- `Business Logic` Interaction of the token with different modules of a protocol
- `Consensus` Providing sufficient incentives to guarantee that participating nodes agree on a distributed state of the network.
- `Collaboration` Nudging (aggregated) human behavior and their interaction with the protocol
____

## Understanding
- `Economics` Interaction between different protocols and how finite resources are allocated among all of them



# Polkadot Tokenomics

## Inflation Model
- Expansion in token supply
- Token minted from thin air
  - Used to pay staking rewards for validators and nominators
  - (Indirectly) fund Treasury.
- Central economic variables of the model are
- **Exogenous**
    - Staking rate (Total amount of staked DOT / Total amount of DOT).

- **Endogenous**
    - Optimal staking rate (a sufficient backing for validators to provide reasonable security).

- Total Inflation Rate (`10%`)
______

 - `Inflation Rate` Rate at which the token supply increases
 - `Staking Rate` Rate at which the token supply is locked in staking
 - `Treasury Rate` Rate at which the token supply is allocated to the treasury
 - `Nominator Rate` Rate at which the token supply is allocated to nominators
 - `Validator Rate` Rate at which the token supply is allocated to validators
 - `Slash Rate` Rate at which the token supply is slashed
 - `Burn Rate` Rate at which the token supply is burned
 - `Transaction Fee Rate` Rate at which the token supply is allocated to transaction fees


# Staking: Concept

- Nominated Proof-Of-Stake (NPoS)
- Economic incentives of validators and nominators are aligned with those of the network.
  - Good behavior is rewarded with staking rewards.
  - Malicious/Neglecting behavior is punished (slashed).
- Currently, minimum total stake is ~1.6M DOTs.
- The total stake in the system directly translates to the economic security that it provides.
- Total stake is pooled from validators (self-stake) and their nominators (nominated stake).
    - High degree of inclusion.
    - High security.
    - The goal is to get as much skin-in-the-game as possible.

## Validators

### What makes Validators resilient:

- Self-stake.
- Reputation (identity).
- High future rewards (self-stake + commission).

## Nominators

- Bond tokens for up to 16 validators that they deem trustworthy.
- They have an incentive to find the best ones that match their preferences.
- They are tasked to collectively curate the set of active validators.

   
## Rewards

- `Total Era Reward` All tokens are destined to be paid out within an era . For `polkadot` Once a day.
- `Validators: share` validators receive a share of total rewards relative to their share of era points to the sum of all era points .

## What are Parachains?
- Parachains (or cores) are the layer-1 part of the protocol.
- Blockchains of their own that run in parallel.
    - Highly domain specific and have high degree of flexibility in their architecture.
    - Share same messaging standard to be interoperable and exchange messages through the Relay Chain.
- Polkadot: 43 Parachains, Kusama: 46 Parachains.
- Their state transition function (STF) is registered on the Relay Chain.
    - Validators can validate state transitions without knowing all the data on the Parachain.
    - Collators keep the parachain alive (but are not needed for security).
- Offer their utility to the network.

## Treasury
- The treasury is an on-chain fund that holds DOT token and is governed by all token holders of the network.
- Those funds come from:
    - Transactions
    - Slashes
    - Staking inefficiencies (deviations from optimal staking rate)
- Through governance, everybody can submit proposals to initiate treasury spending.
- It currently holds around 46M DOT.
- Spending is incentivized by a burn mechanism (1% every 26 days).
