# Subkey 


Subkey is a commandline utility included with Substrate. It allows generating and restoring keys for Substrate based chains such as Polkadot, Kusama and a growing number of parachains and Substrate based projects.


## Key generation

```
subkey generate

Secret phrase:       desert piano add owner tuition tail melt rally height faint thunder immune
  Network ID:        substrate
  Secret seed:       0x6a0ea68072cfd0ffbabb40801570fa5e9f3a88966eaed9dedaeb0cf140b9cd8d
  Public key (hex):  0x7acdc47530002fbc50f413859093b7df90c27874aee732dca940ea4842751d58
  Account ID:        0x7acdc47530002fbc50f413859093b7df90c27874aee732dca940ea4842751d58
  Public key (SS58): 5Eqipnpt5asTm7sCFWQeJjsNJX5cYVJMid3zjKHjDUGKBJTo
  SS58 Address:      5Eqipnpt5asTm7sCFWQeJjsNJX5cYVJMid3zjKHjDUGKBJTo

## Components

### Secret Phrase
- **Description**: Also known as a mnemonic or seed phrase, it is a series of words that can be used to recover or restore a blockchain account.
- **Importance**: Extremely sensitive, as anyone with access to this phrase can access the account's assets.

### Network ID
- **Description**: Identifies the specific blockchain network the account belongs to.
- **Example**: `substrate` indicates the account is on a blockchain built using the Substrate framework.

### Secret Seed
- **Description**: Cryptographic seed derived from the secret phrase, used to generate all associated keys and addresses.
- **Format**: Hexadecimal representation.

### Public Key (Hex)
- **Description**: The public component of your account's key pair, used to receive transactions.
- **Format**: Hexadecimal.

### Account ID
- **Description**: Uniquely identifies your account on the blockchain, usually identical to the Public Key (Hex).
- **Usage**: Used internally for transaction processing and network operations.

### Public Key (SS58)
- **Description**: Formatted version of the public key for Substrate-based blockchains.
- **Features**: Includes a checksum and network identifier, enhancing robustness and verifiability.

### SS58 Address
- **Description**: The address used to receive funds and interact on the blockchain.
- **Note**: Derived from the public key, includes network-specific encoding.

## Security Recommendations

- **Keep your Secret Phrase and Secret Seed private and secure.**
- **Do not share your Secret Phrase with anyone.**
- **Use a hardware wallet or another secure method of storing your keys if possible.**

## Usage

Share your **SS58 Address** with others to receive transactions. Use the public key for verification purposes in transactions and smart contracts.

For more information on managing Substrate accounts, refer to the official [Substrate Documentation](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/).

## Disclaimer

This information is sensitive and should be handled with utmost care. Improper handling can lead to loss of assets.
